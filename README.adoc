= role_unit

The goal of this project is to test your ansible system automation. Its goal is basically to test ansible roles, but role_unit's own tests are an example of an other usage that can be made.

== prerequisites

* bash_unit
* docker
* ansible

== usage

To create a new role tested with role_unit, place yourself in the directory where you want the role and run role_unit:

----
cd /my/ansible/dir/roles
/path/to/role_unit my_role
----

This will create an empty role with the testing tools in the tests directory. A default tests file is created that run on the default container (debian9). To adapt the used distribution set the RU_ENV_IMAGE variable (see below).

You have a list of functions you can call in your test file, described below.

=== ru_init

Initiates testing environment, i.e. creates containers or virtual machines depending on configuration.

=== ru_ansible_init

Initiates ansible inventory and playbook necessary to test your ansible role.

=== ru_run_ansible

Actually run ansible-playbook on your testing environment.

=== ru_run [ -n N ] cmd ...

Runs the specified command on all of the servers or just on the one specified. N is the number of the server you want to run the command on.

=== ru_ansible_fact [ -n N ] fact_name...

Returns the specified ansible fact for all of the servers or just on the one specified. N is the number of the server you want to get the fact from.

== parameters

Plumb_unit behaviour can be changed using environment variables:
* RU_ENV_NAME defines the testing environment name. It is the name of the role you will test.
* RU_ENV_IMAGE defines the system image used to create test environment.
* RU_COUNT sets the number of containers or virtual machines

== tests

=== prerequisites

Role_unit is tested with role_unit, so preprequisites are the same.

=== run

The tests are described in the .travis.yml file.

To run the tests, you will have to launch the commands in the "script" part of the .travis.yml file.
